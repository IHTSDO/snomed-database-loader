# SNOMED CT DATABASE

PostgreSQL SQL Scripts to create and populate a PostgreSQL database with a SNOMED CT terminology release

## Minimum Specification

- PostgreSQL v.9

# Creating the SNOMED CT schema on PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an [`ORDBMS`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORDBMS) therefore every Database is self-contained object. A _"database"_ contains logins, one or more schemas, groups, etc. and every conection is related to a sigle database.

## Diffences from the MySQL version

- PostgreSQL does not need `engine=myisam` which by itself is a bit strange as `myisam` does not support foreign keys.
- Changes `database` for `schema`
- using the `unique` constraint instead of `key`

## Scripted Installation (Mac & Unix)

run load_release-postgresql.sh

<rf2 archive="" location="">
  <schemaname>
  <loadtype -="" delta|snap|full|all="">
</loadtype>
</schemaname>
</rf2>

eg ./load_release-postgresql.sh ~/Backup/SnomedCT_RF2Release_INT_20150731.zip SCT_20150731 SNAP

Note that the scripted installation will now support loading other Editions. The script asks for a module identifier, which is INT by default, for the international edition. Loading the US Edition, for example, would work as follows: `Enter module string used in filenames [INT]: US1000124`

## Manual Installation

1. Download the SNOMED CT terminology release from the IHTSDO web site
2. Create the database using the db create-database-postgres.sql script or skip/perform this action manually if you'd like the data to be loaded into a existing/different database.
3. Create the tables using the db appropriate environment.sql script. The default file creates tables for full, snapshot and delta files and there's also a -full-only version.
4. Edit the db appropriate load.sql script with the correct location of the SNOMED CT release files An alternative under unix or mac would be to create a symlink to the appropriate directory eg `ln -s /your/snomed/directory RF2Release`
5. Load the database created using the edited load.sql script from the relevant command prompt, again by default for full, snapshot and delta unless you only want the full version.
