# SNOMED CT MySQL Release Files Loader with Optimized Views
## SnomedRfsMySql 2021-02-01

## INSTRUCTION ON USE

See http://snomed.org/snomedmysql for detailed instruction on use of this package.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

This loader has been tested to work with MySQL 8.x and with the earlier version 5.7.

Use with MySQL version 8.x requires the server to reference a copy of the file *cnf/my_snomedserver.cnf* as an additional configuration file.

# Support for Use on Mac Systems

The package includes two bash scripts for use on a Mac.

## bash/snomed_config_mysql

* Applies the required MySQL configuration settings in *cnf/my_snomedserver.cnf* to the server.

## bash/snomed_load_mysql

1. Collects user input to configure the following settings:
    - Name of the SQL import script to be used (default: create_latest)
        - Note VP_latest refers to the file *mysql_load/sct_mysql_load_create_latest.sql*
    - Path to SNOMED CT release file package
    - Name of the database schema to be created (default: snomedct)
    - MySQL database username for running the SNOMED CT import script (default: root)
2. Configures the import script to use the chosen settings
3. Builds a Transitive Closure snapshot file (from the relationships release file)
4. Prompts for the MySQL password
5. Runs the SNOMED CT MySQL import script

# Other Operating System Environments

In other environments the following steps may need to be carried out manually.
* MySQL configuration changes
* Running the Perl script to generate the Transitive Closure snapshot file.
* Modifying and running the SNOMED CT MySQL import script *mysql_load/sct_mysql_load_create_latest.sql*.

The notes below outline the extent to which the scripts may be useful in other environments and outline steps required to run the processes manually.

## Other Unix Based Systems

### Configuration Settings on Other Unix Based Systems

As written the script *bash/snomed_mysql_config* is unlikely to work on other Unix based systems. This is because it assumes the default location for configuration files on the Mac.
Therefore, you will need to manually adjust the settings to include the settings in the *cnf/my_snomedserver.cnf* file in one of the configuration file read when the MySQL server is started.

### Loading the SNOMED CT Release Package on Other Unix Based Systems

This script *bash/snomed_mysql_load* should work in most Unix based environments. It uses the bash shell and general purpose unix utilities. However, it has not been tested except on the Mac, so some changes might be necessary.

If it does not work please refer to the notes on use on Widnows systems below for a description of the required manual steps.

## Support for Use on Windows

## win/snomed_wconfig_mysql.bat

* Applies the required MySQL configuration settings in *win/snomed_win_my.cnf* to the server.

## win/snomed_wload_mysql.bat

1. Collects user input to configure the following settings:
    - Name of the SQL import script to be used (default: create_latest)
        - Note VP_latest refers to the file *mysql_load/sct_mysql_load_create_latest.sql*
    - Path to SNOMED CT release file package
    - Name of the database schema to be created (default: snomedct)
    - MySQL database username for running the SNOMED CT import script (default: root)
2. Configures the import script to use the chosen settings
3. Builds a Transitive Closure snapshot file (from the relationships release file)
4. Prompts for the MySQL password
5. Runs the SNOMED CT MySQL import script

### Configuration Settings on Windows Systems

Manually adjust the settings to include the settings in the *cnf/my_snomedserver.cnf* file in one of the configuration file read when the MySQL server is started.

### Loading the SNOMED CT Release Package on Other Unix Based Systems

1. Create a copy of the file *mysql_load/sct_mysql_load_VP_latest.sql*
    - Name the new file: *mysql_load_local.sql*
2. Open the file *mysql_load_local.sql* in text editor. 
3. Use the text editor to replace all instances of the following three placeholders:
    - $RELPATH with the full path to the folder containing the SNOMED CT release package you want to import.
    - $RELDATE with the YYYYDDMM representation of the release date (e.g. 20190731)
    - $DBNAME with the name of the database schema you want to create (e.g. snomedct).
4. Save the file *mysql_load_local.sql*.
5. Run the following command line:

    mysql --defaults-extra-file="*my_snomedimport_client.cnf*"  --protocol=tcp --host=localhost --default-character-set=utf8mb4 --comments --user *mysql_username* --password  < "*mysql_load_local.sql*"

### NOTES
- The full path names of the following files should be included on the command line enclosed in quotation marks.
  - "*my_snomedimport_client.cnf*"
  - "*mysql_load_local.sql*"
- The *mysql_username* must either be **root** or another account with rights to drop and create database schemas. You will be required to enter the password for this account when running the command.
- There are spaces before each of the double dashes in the command line.
